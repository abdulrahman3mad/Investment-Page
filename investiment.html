                        This means VCs take on substantial risks and can be faced with the decision of continuing to

                        company if it’s failing, or to make the hard choice to let it fail. It’s an investment strategy

                        performance and high returns from rapidly growing businesses.

                                            business development experts, product managers, consultants, former

                                        <li class="list-group-item"><span>2. </span>VCs tend to examine your networking

                                            deals.</li>

                                            and meetings, but the hours are kinder and the workplace is more relaxed.

                                            varied backgrounds get alook-in. You require good deal-experience, good
                                            communication skills, and the ability to source investment opportunities.
                                            It helps if you have sound knowledge of technology/biotech
                                            or health care fields and can convince the company that you are interested
                                            in various industries, including start-ups.
